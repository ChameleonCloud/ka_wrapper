# The Site Config

This directory is used to contain all config for deploying kolla-ansible. This consists of the following:

- `globals.yml`: top level config values, these override all other settings in host_vars and group vars. The directory containing globals.yml is passed to the kolla-ansible CONFIG_DIR variable.
- `inventory` and the `host_vars` and `group_vars` under it: the ansible inventory, passed to kolla-ansible via the --inventory argument. These values are overriden by ones in globals.yml
- `passwords.yml` these passwords will be generated by invoking kolla-genpwd

## The inventory files

customization of what hosts are in which groups should be placed in inventory/01-custom-hosts. 02-kolla-train does not need to be changed in most cases.

## Notes on variables

We should *not* use any of the following for configuration, because the values will be overriden by defaults in kolla-ansible:
- group_vars/all.yml
- variables set directly inside the inventory files
